# Hello, World!

My interests are in computer vision & medical image processing, and machine learning. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing (mainly), (a bit of) biophotonics, and medicine. 

I'm now working on some interesting projects:

*  [**Visualization and localization of blood vessels in speckle images**](https://friscolt.github.io/bloodvessels)
*  [**Classification of kidney stones in endoscopic images**](https://friscolt.github.io/kidneystones)
*  [**Breast classification on mammography images** `(New project)`](https://friscolt.github.io/mammography)
*  [**Visualization and analysis of colonies growing in speckle images**  `(New project)`](https://friscolt.github.io/coloniesgrowing)


If you want to know more about these projects, you can click on the points above. If you want to discuss things of images, or make a collaboration, send me an [email](mailto:francisco.lopez@inaoe.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Hello,%20Francisco), or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Friscolt).

Cheers,
Francisco 🇲🇽
